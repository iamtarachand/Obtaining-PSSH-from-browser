# Obtaining-PSSH-from-browser

Here’s a modified EME Logger to automatically convert long PSSH to short PSSH and copy it.

You just need to have a script manager like Tampermonkey installed and create a new script.

Here’s the script:
[https://github.com/iamtarachand/Obtaining-PSSH-from-browser/blob/main/UserScript](https://github.com/iamtarachand/Obtaining-PSSH-from-browser/blob/main/UserScript)

After you enable the script and open a DRM video, it’ll show the PSSH and automatically copy it for you.
